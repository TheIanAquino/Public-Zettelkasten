Personal knowledge management is the maintenance of one's knowledge through various systems that aid the intake of information.

One thing I do, for example, is writing all information I consume within [[Obsidian::https://obsidian.md/]], a centralized local platform.

As I write, I implement hierarchies in my work such as the [[PARA Method::https://fortelabs.co/blog/para/]] of Tiago Forte.

While this section is not yet furbished, you can look into a form of Personal Knowledge Management (PKM) that is public, which I'm doing right now: [[Digital Gardens]].
