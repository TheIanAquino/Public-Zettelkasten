Hello there! ðŸ‘‹

Ian here. So I've been experimenting on this thing for a while now and I've figured, you know what, it's a great way for me to share information, especially outside social media.

And so naturally, me being the type of person who always wants to experiment with a lot of things, I thought this was a good idea.

This, this, this, this. What the hell is this, anyway? I've said the word too many times already.

You can call this place whatever you want: A blog, a writing space, a work-in-progress, a project, an idea repository (actually, that might be a good one ðŸ¤”), but there's always going to be one thing that stands out.

It's not that I'm biased with this or I'm particularizing a nomenclature, but this type of thing is mostly called a *[[digital garden::https://cagrimmett.com/notes/2020/11/08/what-are-digital-gardens/]]* by most internet folks.

To save you a click, I'm going to cite what [[Chuck Grimmet::https://cagrimmett.com/]], a blogger, has to say:
>### What is a digital garden?
>
ðŸ‘‰ A collection of thoughts, ideas, highlights, annotations, quotes, summaries, and notes that are richer than a tweet, but lack the timestamped nature of a blog post or published essay.
Digital gardens are tended to and evolve over time. Sometimes they grow, sometimes they get trimmed back. Though they change, they have the four-dimensional permanence of a river or Theseusâ€™s Ship.
>
ðŸ‘‰ A digital garden embodies the nature of working in public and learning out loud: Sharing your current understanding and allowing others to learn from it.
>
ðŸ‘‰ Like entangled roots and interwoven vines, the individual plants of digital gardens form a latticework of bi-directionally linked content that supports and encourages bridging and pollination to further understanding.

So, in essence, this website is a digital garden -- a place where I can share anything I want, and cultivate them as I go. I mean... look at this way of writing -- does it not sound familiar to you? Almost meander-y, in some sense (if that ever is a word, excuse my lack of adjectives ðŸ˜‚). Hmm, let me see.

Casual!

There we go. The way I write, it's not something planned or formalized or forced. I allow myself to be free from constraint and just type whatever it is that I want. After all, that's the purpose of this website. It's like my bedroom, you know? Where I think, think, think, and think -- all the time. The only difference is that it's my public bedroom. Like some sort of a place where everyone can hang out and do hangout stuff.

It's where I talk about the books I read, movies I watch, games I play, experiences I have, memories I want to solidify, ideas I want to develop -- or destroy -- and just about everything else in between.

Oh, and here's a cool thing I'm planning. Since I'm gonna be writing about a plethora of topics, I'm implementing an organizational system in every writing that I publish. This system will range from 0-*n*, n being an undefined number. 0 will be attributed to the materials that are in their most nascent form, like this one you're reading right now. And as the indicator goes higher, it would mean that the element it's attributed to would be of much greater development than any of its predecessors. So 0 will be the most basic form of an idea and 99 would be its giga-chad, ultra-mega-awakened-9999iq-Albert-Einstein version.

At the moment, you can see this system by clicking on the [Tags](/tags) pane of this website. If you go there right now, you'll see that I have yet to go above 0, so that means I haven't developed anything yet. As I progress, however, things will be much cooler. I know, I know. Sounds boring, but I'm super excited to see what ideas I will have to grapple with! ðŸ’ª

If this idea sounds awesome, I can promise you a phenomenal ride: one filled with bumps, zigzags, and full 360s.

In the future, I will surely edit this part of my digital garden and explain things in a more accurate manner. For now, I'm categorizing this post as 0, as I have already said.

You get the point.

And so I think that's it for now, reader. I'll see you soon, and enjoy your stay! ðŸ‘‹

Before you go, here's a fun thing to do: go introduce yourself to me by giving me a follow on Twitter, and let's talk about anything! ðŸ‘‰[[CLICK ME::https://twitter.com/theianaquino]]
