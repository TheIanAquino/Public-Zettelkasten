A digital garden is a repository wherein a digital gardener stores his nascent thoughts with the intention to develop them in the future. A digital garden is not limited to a single, precise definition, but it remains true to the following characteristics:

Digital gardens are like books, but continuously revisioned.

1. [[Digital gardens are constructive, rather than destructive.]]

2. [[Digital gardens encourage thinking.]]

3. [[Digital gardens evolve over time.]]
