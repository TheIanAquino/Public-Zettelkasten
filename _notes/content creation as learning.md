In creating content, I believe in the following principle:

>Much like every endeavor I do, I wish not to paint myself and my ideas as the sum of perfection, but rather that of a continuous and mistake-rich learning process.

Content creation for me is a representation of a tedious learning process. It is not like how a lot of content creators deem it to be: that it is supposed to exhibit your best work. A creator's content should be honest and transparent instead of fake and extremely polished.

I think of it in the aesthetic of offroad cars. A little bit of dirt provides -- rather than diminishes -- beauty.
