A digital garden is not simply a repository of ideas where a person can put any of his thoughts.

Technically, a digital gardener can do so, but he would miss the goal of digital gardens: to cultivate information.

A digital gardener allows his thoughts to grow the same way a gardener takes care of his plants. In doing so, a digital gardener gets to the essence of information, encouraging the creation of novel ideas throughout the process.
