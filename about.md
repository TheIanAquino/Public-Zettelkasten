Hello and welcome to my [[Digital Gardens\|digital garden!]][["A collection of thoughts, ideas, highlights, annotations, quotes, summaries, and notes that are richer than a tweet, but lack the timestamped nature of a blog post or published essay [(Grimmett, 2020)](https://cagrimmett.com/notes/2020/11/08/what-are-digital-gardens/)".::rsn]]

If you want to know more about this project instead of knowing more about me, go read my [[What the hell is this website?\|introduction to this website]].

As you might've already been able to tell, I'm a graphic design student at [[CIIT Philippines::https://www.ciit.edu.ph/]].

I'm taking up graphic design as an alternative to my desired humanities course, which is sociology, and I think I have a lot of writing juices within me, that's why I started this project. ðŸ˜‚

But! I digress. I'm also someone who's interested in [[Personal Knowledge Management]].

Umm, I also read books ðŸ“š, and I'm soon going to compile a books list here, on my website, including book notes, so stay tuned! ðŸ˜Š

That's about it for the general introduction, I'll add more things here soon as I work on this project. But for now, I think those will suffice.
